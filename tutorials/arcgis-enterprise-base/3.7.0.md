# Deploy Base ArcGIS Enterprise on Single Machine

This workflow demonstrates how to deploy [base ArcGIS Enterprise](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/get-started/latest/windows/base-arcgis-enterprise-deployment.htm) 10.9 on a single machine using the [arcgis-enterprise-base](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-cookbook/tree/master/templates/arcgis-enterprise-base/10.9) deployment template.

**The workflow will:**

* Install Portal for ArcGIS and authorize it. Create the initial administrator account.
* Install Portal for ArcGIS Web Styles.
* Install and configure ArcGIS Web Adaptor for Portal for ArcGIS.
* Install ArcGIS Server, authorize it, create a site, and enable HTTPS in Server Admin.
* Install/configure web server (IIS on Windows or Tomcat on Linux).
* Import the CA-issued certificate if it's defined, or generate a self-signed certificate for the web server.
* Install and configure ArcGIS Web Adaptor for ArcGIS Server.
* Install ArcGIS Data Store and register it as a relational and tile cache store with ArcGIS Server.
* Federate the ArcGIS Server site with the portal and configure the site as the hosting server.

**Supported Platforms:**

* Windows
  - Windows Server 2016 Standard and Datacenter
  - Windows Server 2019 Standard and Datacenter
* Linux
  - Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS
  - Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS
  - Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7
  - Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 8
  - CentOS Linux 7

**Before setting up the deployment, you'll need to have obtained:**

* ArcGIS Enterprise 10.9 setups from [My Esri](https://my.esri.com).
* ArcGIS Enterprise 10.9 authorization files. Make sure to use the correct authorization file for different products. 
* A domain name for your web site
* SSL certificate in PKCS12 (a.k.a. pfx) format issued by certification authority for the domain (Note: If you don't define a CA-cert, this tool will generate and use a self-signed certificate for testing purposes. Self-signed certificates are not supported by Portal for ArcGIS.)

## Step 1. Install Cinc Client

Install [Cinc Client](https://cinc.sh/start/client/) version 15 recommended for Chef Cookbooks for ArcGIS 3.7.0.

### On Windows

Start a Windows PowerShell terminal as an administrator and run:

```powershell
> . { iwr -useb https://omnitruck.cinc.sh/install.ps1 } | iex; install -version 15
```

### On Linux

Run the following command as a superuser:

```bash
$ curl -L https://omnitruck.cinc.sh/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -v 15
```

## Step 2. Download Chef Cookbooks for ArcGIS

Chef Cookbooks for ArcGIS is a collection of cookbooks for configuration, deployment, and management of ArcGIS Enterprise, ArcGIS Pro, and ArcGIS Desktop.

Download Chef Cookbooks for ArcGIS distribution archive and extract it into the Cinc Client workspace directory.

### On Windows

Download the [arcgis-3.7.0-cookbooks.zip](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-cookbook/releases/tag/v3.7.0) archive to the machine.

Extract the contents of arcgis-3.7.0-cookbooks.zip archive to `C:\cinc`.

### On Linux

Download the [arcgis-3.7.0-cookbooks.tar.gz](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-cookbook/releases/tag/v3.7.0) archive to the machine.

Delete `/opt/cinc/cookbooks` and `/opt/cinc/templates` directories and extract the contents of arcgis-3.7.0-cookbooks.tar.gz archive to `/opt/cinc`.

## Step 3. Set up Local ArcGIS Software Repository

The deployment templates require ArcGIS setup archives to install ArcGIS applications. The setup archives must be located in a local or shared ArcGIS Software Repository directory specified by the arcgis.repository.archives attribute. Before running the setups, the setup archives are extracted into a local directory specified using the arcgis.repository.setups attribute.

### On Windows

Create directory `C:\Software\Archives` and copy the ArcGIS Enterprise 10.9 setup archives to that directory:

* ArcGIS_DataStore_Windows_109_177788.exe
* ArcGIS_Server_Windows_109_177775.exe
* ArcGIS_Web_Adaptor_for_Microsoft_IIS_109_177789.exe
* Portal_for_ArcGIS_Windows_109_177786.exe
* Portal_for_ArcGIS_Web_Styles_Windows_109_177787.exe

Create directory `C:\Software\AuthorizationFiles\10.9` and copy the software authorization files for 10.9 ArcGIS Server and Portal for ArcGIS to that directory.

Create directory `C:\Software\Certificates` and copy the SSL certificate to that directory.

### On Linux

Create directory `/opt/software/archives` and copy the following ArcGIS Enterprise 10.9 setup archives to that directory:

* ArcGIS_DataStore_Linux_109_177887.tar.gz
* ArcGIS_Server_Linux_109_177864.tar.gz
* ArcGIS_Web_Adaptor_Java_Linux_109_177888.tar.gz
* Portal_for_ArcGIS_Linux_109_177885.tar.gz
* Portal_for_ArcGIS_Web_Styles_Linux_109_177886.tar.gz
* [apache-tomcat-8.5.63.tar.gz](https://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.63/bin/apache-tomcat-8.5.63.tar.gz) (will be downloaded from the internet if not present in the local ArcGIS software repository)
* [openjdk-11_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz](https://download.java.net/java/ga/jdk11/openjdk-11_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz) (will be downloaded from the internet if not present in the local ArcGIS software repository)

Create directory `/opt/software/authorization_files/10.9` and copy the software authorization files for 10.9 ArcGIS Server and Portal for ArcGIS to that directory.

Create directory `/tomcat_arcgis` and copy the SSL certificate to that directory.

## Step 4. Edit JSON File for the Machine Role and Run Chef

Deployment template arcgis-enterprise-base contains Chef Zero JSON files with sample recipes and attributes for single-machine and multi-machine base ArcGIS Enterprise deployments.

To install base ArcGIS Enterprise on a single machine, edit arcgis-enterprise-primary.json and use it to run Cinc Client in local mode on the machine.

### On Windows

Change the current directory to `C:\cinc`.

Copy file `C:\cinc\templates\arcgis-enterprise-base\10.9\windows\arcgis-enterprise-primary.json` to `C:\cinc`.

Edit the `arcgis-enterprise-primary.json` file in a text editor (the attribute values must be JSON-escaped):

* arcgis.run_as_password - Change to the password of the 'arcgis' Windows user account.
* arcgis.server.private_url - Change to the ArcGIS Server URL that will be used as the hosting server's admin URL.

As a superuser, run the following command:

```bash
$ cinc-client -z -j arcgis-enterprise-primary.json
```

> Note: Your machine needs to allow running sudo to execute commands without a password. On some Linux distributions, sudo is configured to require a tty as a default configuration. This is usually set in `/etc/sudoers` with the entry of `Defaults requiretty`. You can either change the entry to `Defaults !requiretty` in the `/etc/sudoers` file or change this configuration for certain users, groups, or commands. RedHat will remove this default setting, as mentioned in https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1020147.

## Step 5. Clean Up

Once the Chef run successfully completes, save the JSON file in a safe and secure place to use in the future for upgrades or disaster recovery.

The JSON file used in the Chef run contains sensitive information such as passwords. Cinc-client caches attributes read from the JSON files in the workspace directory. Delete/shred the 'nodes' subfolder in the workspace directory after the last Chef run on the machine.

Chef Cookbooks for ArcGIS extract the setup archives into a local directory specified by the `arcgis.repository.setups` attribute. To save disk space, the archives and setups can be deleted after the machine configuration is completed.

---

After the cinc-client run completes, Portal for ArcGIS and ArcGIS Server will be available at `https://<domain name>/portal` and `https://<domain name>/server` URLs respectively.
