# Patch base ArcGIS Enterprise on single machine

This workflow demonstrates how to patch [base ArcGIS Enterprise](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/get-started/latest/windows/base-arcgis-enterprise-deployment.htm) 10.9.1 on a single machine using the [arcgis-enterprise-base]({{ site.baseurl }}/templates/arcgis-enterprise-base/10.9.1.html) deployment template.

> Note: The workflow assumes that the Cinc client was already installed on the machine during the initial deployment.

## 1. Download Chef Cookbooks for ArcGIS v4.0.0

Download the Chef Cookbooks for ArcGIS distribution archive and extract it into the Cinc Client workspace directory.

### On Windows

Change the current directory to `C:\cinc`.

Download the [arcgis-4.0.0-cookbooks.zip](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-cookbook/releases/tag/v4.0.0) archive to the machine.

Delete `C:\cinc\cookbooks` and `C:\cinc\templates` directories and extract the contents of the arcgis-4.0.0-cookbooks.zip archive to `C:\cinc`.

### On Linux

Change the current directory to `/opt/cinc`.

Download the [arcgis-4.0.0-cookbooks.tar.gz](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-cookbook/releases/tag/v4.0.0) archive to the machine.

Delete `/opt/cinc/cookbooks` and `/opt/cinc/templates` directories and extract the contents of the arcgis-4.0.0-cookbooks.tar.gz archive to `/opt/cinc`.

## 2. Download ArcGIS Enterprise 10.9.1 Patches

Download the released base ArcGIS Enterprise 10.9.1 patches from the global ArcGIS software repository into a local patches folder.

### On Windows

Copy file `C:\cinc\templates\arcgis-enterprise-base\10.9.1\windows\arcgis-enterprise-patches.json` to `C:\cinc`.

Start a command prompt window as administrator and run:

```shell
> cinc-client -z -j arcgis-enterprise-patches.json
```

### On Linux

Copy file `/opt/cinc/templates/arcgis-enterprise-base/10.9.1/linux/arcgis-enterprise-patches.json` to `/opt/cinc`.

Run the following command as a superuser:

```bash
$ cinc-client -z -j arcgis-enterprise-patches.json
```

> Note: Your machine needs to allow running sudo to execute commands without a password. On some Linux distributions, sudo is configured to require a tty as a default configuration. This is usually set in `/etc/sudoers` with the entry of `Defaults requiretty`. You can either change the entry to `Defaults !requiretty` in the `/etc/sudoers` file or change this configuration for certain users, groups, or commands. RedHat will remove this default setting, as mentioned in <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1020147>.

## 3. Apply the Patches

Apply the base ArcGIS Enterprise 10.9.1 patches specified in the arcgis-enterprise-patches-apply.json file of the arcgis-enterprise-base deployment template.

### On Windows

Copy file `C:\cinc\templates\arcgis-enterprise-base\10.9.1\windows\arcgis-enterprise-patches-apply.json` to `C:\cinc`.

Review the lists of patches specified in the arcgis-enterprise-patches-apply.json file:

* arcgis.portal.patches - Portal for ArcGIS patches.
* arcgis.server.patches - ArcGIS Server patches.
* arcgis.data_store.patches - ArcGIS Data Store patches.
* arcgis.web_adaptor.patches - ArcGIS Web adaptor patches.

Run as administrator:

```shell
> cinc-client -z -j arcgis-enterprise-patches-apply.json
```

### On Linux

Copy file `/opt/cinc/templates/arcgis-enterprise-base/10.9.1/linux/arcgis-enterprise-patches-apply.json` to `/opt/cinc`.

Review the lists of patches specified in the arcgis-enterprise-patches-apply.json file:

* arcgis.portal.patches - Portal for ArcGIS patches.
* arcgis.server.patches - ArcGIS Server patches.
* arcgis.data_store.patches - ArcGIS Data Store patches.
* arcgis.web_adaptor.patches - ArcGIS Web adaptor patches.

Run the following command as a superuser:

```bash
$ cinc-client -z -j arcgis-enterprise-patches-apply.json
```

## Step 4. Clean Up

Once the Chef run successfully completes, save the JSON file in a safe and secure place to use in the future for upgrades or disaster recovery.

The cinc-client reads attributes from the JSON files and caches the attributes inside a 'nodes' folder that resides in the Chef workspace directory. Because some of the attributes in the JSON file may contain sensitive information, such as passwords, it is recommended that you delete the 'nodes' folder in the Chef workspace directory after you complete the last Chef run on the machine.

Congratulations! You have successfully patched the base ArcGIS Enterprise deployment.
